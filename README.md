Shrimpo makes creating AI easy! It uses keywords similar to those in Google's DialogFlow and is a good alternative. To make your first chatbot, follow these 3 steps:

<br>

```console
npm i shrimpo
```

<br><br>

## 1. Train

Training the chatbot is simple. You need to make an intent, like a category, such as "Greetings", or "Insults". Then you must pass an array of training data - something that the chatbot can recognise as a greeting or insult. Then, finally, you can pass some training responses - what the chatbot will respond to those insults or greetings with. For example:

```js
const Shrimpo = require("shrimpo");
let ai = new Shrimpo();


ai.train("Greetings", 
  ["Hi", "Hello", "Hey"],
  ["Hey! How are you?", "Hows it going?"]
);


ai.train("Insults",
  ["You're ugly", "You smell", "You suck"],
  ["No you", "I don't care"]
);
```

<br>

## 2. Set a default phrase

You can't train a chatbot everything, and when it is prompted with something that it has no match to, it'll resort to using a default phrase. You can pass a singular string as this, or an array where one will be randomly picked. For example:

```js
ai.defaults = "I don't get what you mean";


ai.defaults = [
  "Sorry, I don't know that one!",
  "Sorry, I don't know what you mean.",
  "I didn't quite catch that. Could you rephrase?"
];
```

<br>

## 3. Ask!

Now just simply ask it something!

```js
console.log(ai.ask("Hi!"));
```

This makes for an easy, and pretty good chatbot! But wait! We can do even more!

## Importing Shrimpo Datasets

Shrimpo datasets look something like this:

```json
{
  "Greetings": {
    "trainingPhrases": ["hi", "hello", "hey"],
    "trainingResponses": ["Hey! How are you?", "How's it going?"],
    "minimumMatchValue": 0.5
  },

  "Insults": {
    "trainingPhrases": ["you suck", "you smell"],
    "trainingResponses": ["No you", "I don't care"],
    "minimumMatchValue": 0.3
  },

  "Farewell": {
    "trainingPhrases": ["bye", "see you later"],
    "trainingResponses": ["Goodbye!", "Take care!"],
    "minimumMatchValue": 0.6
  }
}
```

with the ai.import() function you can import datasets locally. A Shrimpo-Standard dataset is being heavily worked on at the moment and will soon be released to the public. E.g.

```js
const path = require("path");

ai.import(__dirname  + "/dataset.json");

//OR

ai.import("./dataset.json");

//OR

ai.import(path.join(__dirname + "/dataset.json"));
```

## Learning Mode

Coming soon! Requires import() so extra learning can be saved.
